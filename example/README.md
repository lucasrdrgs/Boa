# DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION FOR THE LOVE OF GOD

# Read me
Drop boa.py in this directory.
## How to run
Preferably run this in a virtualenv. You should also install `bs4` and Flask, this is a Jinja replacement and not a framework afterall, so you can also have it working with Django in some project of yours. I recommend Flask though. Then do `python app.py`.
