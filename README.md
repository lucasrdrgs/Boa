# Boa
Boa Hypertext Processor for Python

## (Dis?)advantages
- It sucks!
- ~~It's super slow, forcing you to use PyPy!~~ Has been optimized since. No need for PyPy anymore.
- It sucks!
- Single `.py` file to handle hypertext processing!
- Around ~~300~~ 200 lines of super high quality and high fidelityâ„¢ code!
- Templating support (like Jinja's {% block ... %} and {% extends ... %})!
- Custom components (you can make your own HTML tags pretty much)!
- Did I mention it sucks?
- Compatible with Flask, Django and whatever other Python framework, I hate myself and I want to die.

## Warnings
This is most likely vulnerable to XSS and SQL Injection. Do not use this in production for the love of God.
